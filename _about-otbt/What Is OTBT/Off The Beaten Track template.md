<h3>What is an Off The Beaten Track template?</h3>
<p>Off The Beaten has a <strong>pre-designed itinerary template</strong> that
provides a basic structure that any tourist can access. It includes three
components that users can mix and match in various ways. <strong>This keeps a consistent mix and match of locales or activities by design.</strong>

<blockquote>
<p>With familiarisation, visitors can find and locate information on any
activity or locale to visit quicker</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inspired by our local "cai png" (mixed dishes with rice) - <strong>Off The Beaten Track</strong> has
a simple mix and match structure where tourists can also save time and
frustration â€“ improving their overall site experience.</p>
<p>Additionally, this new template will also serve to be<strong> more accessible for site visitors with disabilities.</strong> For
example, individuals who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies
to navigate websites benefit from our navigation structure and easier for
them to find and access content.</p>

<h3><strong>Here’s how Off The Beaten Track makes it easier:</strong></h3>
<h3>1. A list of pre-approved locales and activities listed</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No need to web search a gazillion sites to find out opening hours, accessibility
or prices. We've already pulled the information and standardised it within
our site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And because we are government sponsored- the service is free to use!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Quick mix &amp; matches based entirely on your interests</h3>
<p>Choice fatigue is definitely a problem but now that we've made the pool
a little smaller but surer you can choose from indoor lightweight activities
to a robust day out in the sun or at sea- all customised to your wants.</p>
<h3>3. Easy-to-use website and navigation</h3>
<p>Off The Beaten Track is made with sites designed by Isomer which are In
line with <a href="https://designsystem.tech.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Government Design System (SGDS)</a>
</p>
<p>Isomer’s components follow standards set by&nbsp;SGDS, which ensures that
our website automatically keeps good user interface and experience practices.</p>

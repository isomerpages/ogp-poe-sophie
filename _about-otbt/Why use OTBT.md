<p>Off The Beaten Track shares a belief that you can try a different kind
of travel but it can still be easy and fun. We want any visitor to be able
to make up their own itineraries without too much muss and fuss. Here’s
how Off The Beaten Track makes it easier:</p>
<h3>1. A list of pre-approved locales and activities listed</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No need to web search a gazillion sites to find out opening hours, accessibility
or prices. We've already pulled the information and standardised it within
our site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And because we are government sponsored- the service is free to use!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Quick mix &amp; matches based entirely on your interests</h3>
<p>Choice fatigue is definitely a problem but now that we've made the pool
a little smaller but surer you can choose from indoor lightweight activities
to a robust day out in the sun or at sea- all customised to your wants.</p>
<h3>3. Easy-to-use website and navigation</h3>
<p>Off The Beaten Track is made with sites designed by Isomer which are In
line with <a href="https://designsystem.tech.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Government Design System (SGDS)</a>
</p>
<p>Isomer’s components follow standards set by&nbsp;SGDS, which ensures that
our website automatically keeps good user interface and experience practices.</p>

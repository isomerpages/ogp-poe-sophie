<p><strong>Off The Beaten Track (by Isomer) is a small local collective dedicated to finding new alternative tourist friendly spots and activities for both foreigners and locals alike. </strong>
</p>
<p>Our local non-profit co-operative aims to <strong>effectively</strong> offer
both citizens and foreigners new activities to participate and exploring
about our city, whilst also enabling them to <strong>easily access the information</strong> they
were looking for and also<strong> navigate safely </strong>around our island.</p>

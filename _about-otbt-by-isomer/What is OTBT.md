can offer so much more.</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>
</p>
<p>Our local non-profit co-operative aims to <strong>effectively</strong> offer
both citizens and foreigners new activities to participate and exploring
about our city, whilst also enabling them to <strong>easily access the information</strong> they
were looking for and also<strong> navigate safely </strong>around our island.</p>

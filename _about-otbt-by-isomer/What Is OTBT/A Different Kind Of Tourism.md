<h3>In Pursuit of A Different Kind of Tourism</h3>
<p>Amidst new social media trends, crowd control problems and environmental
challenges, <strong>Off The Beaten Track</strong> envisions a different option
and nature of tourism that Singapore wishes to pursue as quality tourism.</p>
<p>This new model of development tackles three steps for success:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The first step recognises tourism as a continuing an important economic
driver for Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second step seeks to achieve a balance in tourism development that
will result in productive and innovative opportunities for Singaporeans
whilst also encouraging further interest and future investment;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third step sees continuing efforts to nurture public engagement and
participation as part of this new development.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to secure this quality tourism growth, <strong>Off The Beaten Track</strong> will
pursue small term strategies and campaigns to encourage new participants
to engage in these destinations and engagements.</p>

description: Who uses Off The Beaten Track
---
<h5><strong>Off The Beaten Track best caters to tourists (local and foreign) who are interested in trying something different, quick and easy:</strong></h5>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Foreign Tourists who have visited the country multiple times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Locals who are already acquainted with the local hot spots and want to
try something unique.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples include:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Annual activities:</strong> Promoting annual initiatives that are
lesser known.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seasonal Activities at Less-Popular Attractions:</strong> Haw Par
Villa's Hell Museum Tour in the Seventh Month (Ghost Month) and October.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h5><strong>Off The Beaten Track is not ideal for everyone:</strong></h5>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Tourists who are here for short stop-over visits but we are working on
developing some <a href="offthebeatentrackin24hours.sg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">specific travel itineraries</a>.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tourists who are seeking for the next hip food place to take Instagram
photos. (They already exist!)</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Common misconceptions on what we do include:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>We are not the place to inform you where the best chicken rice place is in Singapore:</strong> These
questions simply spark cultural wars- we encourage you to try out a few
different famous spots from and judge for yourself!</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>We are not an e-commerce discount website:</strong> We are a non-profit
collective and are not currently working with any third party providers
on selling any products, goods or services.</p>

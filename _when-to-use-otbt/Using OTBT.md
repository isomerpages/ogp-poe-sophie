<h5><strong>Off The Beaten Track (By Isomer) best caters to tourists (local and foreign) who are interested in something different:</strong></h5>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Foreign Tourists who have visited the country multiple times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Locals who are already acquainted with the local hot spots and want to
try something unique.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples include:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Annual activities:</strong> Promoting annual initiatives that are
lesser known.</p>

<h5><strong>Off The Beaten Track (By Isomer) is not ideal for everyone:</strong></h5>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Tourists who are here for short stop-over visits but we are working on
developing some <a href="offthebeatentrackin24hours.sg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">specific travel itineraries</a>.</p>
<p></p>
